# Cloudformation

Ability to draw your cloudformation stack and download the template for use, and the diagram as architecture documentation.

Data Structure

JSON should be the same as the Cloudformation stack (actually this is mandatory).

It needs to be translated to and from but lets work on translating to JSON from internal data structure.

```
[
    {
        "id": "some arbitrary id format",
        
    }
]
```
